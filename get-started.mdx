## Create an account and learn how to model with sumtyme.ai.

[Create your sumtyme account](https://www.sumtyme.ai/signup) to begin modelling complex multiscale systems, from shifting financial markets to evolving climate patterns in minutes.

Once you've got your API key, follow our [**walkthrough guide**](/quickstart/finance) to analyse your first multiscale system and learn our modelling approach.

### Why us?

- Deterministic Insights: map the specific causal trajectory of change from its point of inception rather than a probabilistic distribution.
- Zero Information Loss: track the signal's propagation through multiple time scales in real-time with no smoothing or data loss common in statistical modelling.
- Continual Learning: allow the CIL to use its understanding of how causal structures evolve to remain accurate in transition states where no historical data exists.

### Common CIL Use Cases
<Card title="Identify Change at Point of Inception" icon="text-align-start" color="black" horizontal href="/quickstart/finance.mdx">
  While traditional approaches quantify how much an asset has deviated from its historical average, the CIL identifies change at its point of inception. By tracking an asset's price as it evolves, the CIL eliminates the dangerous lag of a N-day moving average.
